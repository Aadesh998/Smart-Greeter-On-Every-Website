# 🌟 AI Greeter - Chrome Extension

**AI Greeter** is a lightweight Chrome extension that brings some good vibes every time you open a new tab or visit a new site. It greets you based on the time of day, your name, and the site you’re visiting — sometimes even offering motivational nudges on platforms like LeetCode!

## 🚀 Features

- 🤖 Smart greetings powered by Groq's LLaMA3 model  
- 🕒 Time-based dynamic messages (morning, afternoon, evening)  
- 🌐 Website-aware — changes greeting depending on what site you’re on  
- 💬 Custom messages on LeetCode, WhatsApp, Zomato, and more

## 🛠️ How It Works

The extension injects a small script into every page you visit. It checks:
- The time of day
- The website’s URL
- The page path (for special treatment like LeetCode problem pages)

Then, it sends a prompt to Groq’s LLaMA3 model to generate a friendly message just for you!
